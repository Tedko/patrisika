Patrisika
===================================

An library converts orthogonal AST into SpiderMonkey AST.

Semantic Definitions
-----------------------------------
AST for Patrisika is provided as JavaScript arraies. The following forms represents a node:

### 'identifier'
Represents a variable.
### ['.t', 'name']
Represents a temporary variable.
### ['.lit', value]
Represents a literal value.
### ['.this']
Represents the `this` reference.
### ['.fn', patternParameters, nodeBody]
Represents a function literal. Note that *patternParameters* matches the whole argument list.
### ['.list', ...items]
Represents an array literal.
### ['.obj', ...['propName', propValue, Îµ | 'get' | 'set']]
Represents an object literal.
### ['.', base, member]
Represents a membering operation, i.e. `base[member]`.
### ['.if', condition, consequent, alternate?]
Represents a conditional evaluation.
### ['.while', condition, body]
Represents a while loop evaluation. It always returns `undefined`.
### ['.seq', ...items]
Represents a sequencial evaluation. Returns the last item evaluated.
### ['.return', value]
Return a value. Similar to JavaScript `return` statement.
### ['.label', 'sLabel', body]
Declare a labelled expression. Labels are used by `.break` nodes.
### ['.break', 'sLabel']
Jumps to the position after the labelled expression `'sLabel'`.
### [fn, ...args]
Once `fn` is a valid node, it means a common function invocation.

Current Passes
-----------------------------------

###Early Semantic Expansion
- **expand-fn-literal** : Expand irregular and optional parameters of function literals
- **expand-try-catch** : Regularize the 2nd argument of `[.try]` nodes
- **expand-assignments** : Expand irregular assignments
- **expand-this** : Expand `[.this]` nodes into `[.t]` nodes

###Variable Scoping
- **resolve-variable-scoping** : Create `[.local]` nodes to handle variable declarations, constant declarations, and variable renaming.
- **convert-eqc** : Convert all `[=c]` nodes into `[=]` nodes. `[=c]` nondes have the same semantics as `[=]`s but are used for constant declarations only.

###Later Semantic Expansion
- **check-break** : Check and rename `[.label]` nodes and `[.break]` nodes.
- **expand-object-literal** : Expand complex object literal (`[.obj]`) nodes into JavaScript-style nodes, which means that there is no 'get' or 'set' kind property pair.
- **cps** : Convert sequences into nested callbacks.

###Optimization
- **expand-iife** : Expand immediately-invoked function expressions into straight statements.

###Regularization

- **regular-nest** : Convert freely-combined nodes into statement-expression hierarchy
- **resolve-t-scoping** : "Declare" all T-variables used
- **denest-seq** : Flatten nesting `[.seq]` nodes

###Transformation
- **codegen** : Convert Patrisika AST into Mozilla AST
